# Getting Started

The template has several features which make createing a concept quick and easy.

### Desktop or Mobile

The template comes with elements for both tablet/desktop and mobile. To switch between the different device types click 'page list' dropdown at the top of the 'layer list' left sidebar. 

**Ignore the symbol editor, unless you want to edit the default import symbols.**

### Inserting a symbol

Symbols are Sketch's way of importing a module that has already been created. It allows you to simply drop in the module, without needing to build them yourself every time. To insert a symbol into your layout, select the 'insert' button from the top toolbar, and then hover over 'symbol'. This will show a list of tablet and mobile symbols that are available to import. 

**It is important to detach any imported symbols to avoid overwriting the default modules supplied with the template. See 'Detaching a symbol' below to learn how to do this**

 in the 'layer list' left sidebar is editing the default modules/symbols.**

To detach a symbol, right click the purple symbol folder in the 'layers list', and choose 'detach from symbol'. This will create a copy of the defult symbol, so you can edit it directly on the page without altering the default modules/symbols.
